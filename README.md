# SkillWatch

## What is it?
Skillwatch is an add-on for FFXI's third-party loader and hook Ashita (https://www.ashitaxi.com/).
Very simply, the purpose of this add-on is to have a clearer way to indentify the moment when enemy mobs "ready" a skill.
This could be useful in a variety of situations, for example, when people are playing with relevant ping issues or the time window to react to such event is in general too short.

## What is not?
This add-on is <b>NOT</b> a bot. It simply provides enhanced feedback on enemy mobs readying their skills with the same timing the typical "X readies Y." message would appear in the chat box.

## How does it work?
In short, it's a combination of parsing the chat box looking for a message, matching it with Entity informations provided by Ashita hook and drawing some visual feedback overlay.
